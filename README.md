# IM380 Gutenberg Block Styles Plugin

## Based on Gutenberg Block Styles Plugin with customisations added as per the block styling requirements for daywalks.co.uk
As I implement new styles I will add further comments here, and also leave the original boilerplate plugin content below to help anyone who wishes to build out their own plugin from the original boilerplate.

## Overview

This repository is an introduction to one of the simplest forms of customization in the editor: Block Styles. Block Styles just add an extra classname to a block, so they're relatively simple to create and customize.

[**ðŸ“„ Customizing Gutenberg blocks with block styles**](https://themeshaper.com/2019/02/15/customizing-gutenberg-blocks-with-block-styles/)

This repository is a WordPress plugin that includes a single custom block style. It's fairly barebones, and is meant to provide a boilerplate for more complicated plugins. The code here is a lightweight introduction to Gutenberg block customization, and doesn't require you to mess around with `npm`, themes, php, or (much) JavaScript. 

All you really need to get started is: 

- The courage to edit a few lines in a single JavaScript file. 
- Knowledge of CSS.
- A WordPress site to upload this plugin to (Alternatively, you can run a single Terminal command to create a quick development environment instead).  

## Customization

Adding + editing block styles is a three step process: 

**1. Open up the `block-styles.js` file and adjust the block type, name, and label for your new block style.**

For example, the built-in example adds a "Blue Paragraph" block style to the core Paragraph block: 

```
wp.blocks.registerBlockStyle( 'core/paragraph', {
	name: 'blue-paragraph',
	label: 'Blue Paragraph'
} );
```

Here's another example, adding an "Awesome Cover" style to the Cover block: 

```
wp.blocks.registerBlockStyle( 'core/cover', {
	name: 'awesome-cover',
	label: 'Awesome Cover'
} );
```

Those four lines are all you need to declare the new block style. The block name in the first line should refer to the official title for the block, but the `name` and `label` can follow whatever format you'd like. `name` will be used to generate a new classname for your block style, so please don't include any spaces there. 

If you'd like to add multiple block styles in the same plugin, just duplicate those four lines.

**2. From there, add the CSS to style your new block style.**

Block style classnames are automatically created using the following format: 

`.is-style-[name]`

`[name]` maps to the `name:` field from step 1. So the classnames for the two examples above would be: 

`.is-style-blue-paragraph`
`.is-style-awesome-cover`

Open up the `style.css` file, and add any CSS styles for your block. Anything you declare should be added to both the front and back end automatically.

**3. Test your changes.**

Zip up the plugin with your changes and upload to your site, or if you'd prefer, test the changes in real-time using the included [Docker-powered dev environment](DOCKER.md). ðŸŽ‰
